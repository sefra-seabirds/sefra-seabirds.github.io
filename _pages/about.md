The SEFRA-seabird model has been developed by Shearwater analystics Ltd., in a process of iterative, project-based work that began in 2019 with funding from the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI, Wellington, New Zealand), and then the CCSBT, ending in 2026. The SEFRA approach is however generic, and was developed within New~Zealand as a means of assessing fisheries impact on protected species, in particular seabirds and marine mammals. The SEFRA accronym and concept was ideated by Ben Sharp whilst working for MPI, and early iterations were conducted by Dragonfly science (Wellington, New Zealand). Subsequently, other researchers have developed and applied SEFRA in different contexts through contractual work with MPI, including Anenome Ltd., Quantifish Ltd. and Proteus Ltd., all of whom have contributed to the evolution of the SEFRA methodology.
